title: Publish a public activity page
description: Publish your workspace's public repository activity, choose who the page names, and leave people out of it.
page_type: feature
---

A public activity page shows who contributed to your workspace's public repositories, to anyone and without sign-in.
Workspace admins and owners publish it in **Workspace settings**, under **Public activity page**.
[Public activity page](./public-activity.mdx) describes what the page shows and how members show or hide themselves.

## Before you publish

- Your instance admin must allow public activity pages. Otherwise, a published page stays private.
- Keep course workspaces private.
- Tell the members before you publish the page.
- Run a repository sync first. A repository appears only after Hephaestus confirms recently that it is public.

## Publish the page

1. Under **Administration**, open **Workspace settings**.
2. Under **Public activity page**, turn on **Publish the page**.
3. Read what becomes public.
4. Select **Make public**.

When Hephaestus confirms that the page is public, the section shows its address.
To preview the page, open the address in a private window.
Signed-in members who open the address see their workspace home instead.
If the section says that public availability is not confirmed, the page is not public yet.

Members and people who signed in are on the page only after they choose to show.
In a workspace with a public page, each member sees a notice that asks them.

To stop the page, turn off **Publish the page**.
It needs no confirmation.
Turning the page off also turns off **Allow search engines** and **Show contributors without an account**.

## Let search engines list the page

**Allow search engines** is off by default.
While it is off, the page asks search engines not to list it.
That is a request, not access control: anyone with the address can open the page.

## Name contributors without an account

**Show contributors without an account** is off by default.
While it is off, the page counts these people without naming them, for example *and 3 more contributors*.
Their work is not in the page's figures.

1. Turn on **Show contributors without an account**.
2. Check your organization's legal basis to publish their names.
3. Select **Show contributors**.

The page then names them until they object.
Turn the setting off to count them without names again.

## See who has not answered

While the page is published, **Members** has a **Public activity** column.
It shows **Not answered yet** for each member who has not answered the question of this workspace.
It never shows which way a member chose.

**People left out of the page** in **Workspace settings** counts the people whom the page leaves out.
It counts people who hid themselves, people who have not answered, and people whom an admin hid.
It never says who hid themselves.

## Leave a person out of the page

To leave out an outside contributor who objects, hide them from **Workspace activity**.
They then leave the public page too.
[Hide a person from workspace activity](./activity.mdx#hide-a-person-from-workspace-activity) gives the steps.
Showing a person again never overrides their own choice to hide.
